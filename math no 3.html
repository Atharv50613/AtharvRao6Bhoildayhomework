    <h2>Aryabhata (476 CE - 550 CE)</h2>
    <p>
        Aryabhata was one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers of ancient India. He is best known for his work in the field of trigonometry, algebra, and astronomy. He is credited with the introduction of the concept of zero and the decimal system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        His major works, the "Aryabhatiya" and "Arya-siddhanta," had a lasting impact on Indian and world mathematics. Aryabhata calculated the value of pi (π) to four decimal places and approximated the length of a year to a remarkably accurate value. He also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis, a concept that was not widely accepted in the world until much later.

    <h2>Bhaskara I (600 CE - 680 CE)</h2>
    <p>
        Bhaskara I was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics. He is well-known for his work in number theory, and for writing a commentary on Aryabhata's works. Bhaskara I was the first to describe the number system, which was used extensively in the Indian subcontinent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bhaskara's major contribution to mathematics includes his work on quadratic equations. He also studied the rules for solving linear equations, providing a systematic way to approach mathematical problems. His most notable mathematical result was his formulation of the "Bhaskara’s Theorem" for the solution of indeterminate equations.

<section id="ramanujan">
    <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887 - 1920)</h2>
    <p>
        Srinivasa Ramanujan was a self-taught Indian mathematician who made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Despite having little formal training, Ramanujan's brilliance was undeniable, and he is regarded as one of the most significant mathematicians in history.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ramanujan is famous for his work on partition theory, his development of infinite series for pi, and his contributions to the study of modular forms. His collaboration with British mathematician G. H. Hardy led to groundbreaking discoveries that have had a lasting impact on mathematics. Ramanujan's work was a vital part of the development of modern mathematics and continues to influence the field today.

<section id="other-mathematicians">
    <h2>Other Notable Indian Mathematicians</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brahmagupta (598 - 668 CE):</strong> Known for his work in algebra and the development of the rules of arithmetic for negative numbers. He is also credited with the first clear description of zero as a number.</li>
        <li><strong>Bhaskara II (1114 - 1185 CE):</strong> Known for his work in calculus, he developed the concept of differential calculus and was one of the first to use methods resembling modern integration and differentiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Nilakantha (1444 - 1545 CE):</strong> A mathematician who contributed to the development of trigonometry, particularly the calculation of the sine of large angles.</li>
        <li><strong>Vidyadhar (15th century CE):</strong> Known for his work in the area of algebra, Vidyadhar's contributions helped in the expansion of algebraic formulas that would later influence Western mathematics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These mathematicians, along with others from ancient and medieval India, have greatly influenced the field of mathematics, not just in India but globally. Their work laid the foundation for many modern mathematical concepts and techniques that are widely used today.
